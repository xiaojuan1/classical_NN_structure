# ðŸ§  Neural Network Architectures for Beginners

This repository is built to help beginners **understand common neural network models** through clean and well-documented PyTorch implementations. Each architecture is implemented with simplicity in mind, focusing on **clarity** and **learning**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

The goal of this project is not just to train accurate models, but to **demystify how neural networks work** internally. Itâ€™s ideal for students and developers who want to learn *how* and *why* these models work.
